    <div class="PP4"> <p id="J">Jimi Hendrix is widely considered to be the greatest guitar player of all time. His creative vision and technical expertise pioneered the sound and use of guitar. Hendrix’s playing synthesized diverse genres, including blues, R&B, soul, British rock, American folk music, and jazz. His influence is evident in a variety of popular music from hard rock to hip hop. His playing techniques have been abundantly imitated by others. Though he tragically lived a short life his impact is immense. Rolling Stone has ranked his three non-posthumous studio albums, Are You Experienced (1967), Axis: Bold as Love (1967), and Electric Ladyland (1968) among the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and ranked him number one on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.

<p1>I feel sad for people who have to judge Jimi Hendrix on the basis of recordings and film alone; because in the flesh he was so extraordinary. He had a kind of alchemist’s ability; when he was on the stage, he changed. He physically changed. He became incredibly graceful and beautiful. It wasn’t just people taking LSD, though that was going on, there’s no question. But he had a power that almost sobered you up if you were on an acid trip. He was bigger than LSD. -Pete Townshend<p/>

</p1> Though his active career as a featured artist lasted a mere four years, Hendrix altered the course of popular music and became one of the most successful and influential musicians of his era. Aninstrumentalist who radically redefined the expressive potential and sonic palette of the electric guitar, he was the composer of a classic repertoire of songs ranging from ferocious rockers to delicate, complex ballads. He also was the most charismatic in-concert performer of his generation. Moreover, he was a visionary who collapsed the genre boundaries of rock, soul, blues, and jazz and an iconic figure whose appeal linked the concerns of white hippies and black revolutionaries by clothing black anger in the colourful costumes of London’s Carnaby Street. -Britannica

<p1>Several weeks ago, Life magazine described Jimi as “a rock demigod” and devoted several color pages to kaleidoscopic projection of his face. Well, why not? The fisheye lens shot on his first album cover shows him in arrogant distortion: on the second album, he becomes Buddha. Lest anyone forget, Leacock-Pennebaker’s Monterey Pop has immortalized his pyromaniacal affair with the guitar. Stories circulate that he is rude to audiences, stands up writers, hangs up photographers, that he doesn’t talk.
What Jimi’s really all about and where his music is going is an altogether different thing. -RollingStone Magazine
