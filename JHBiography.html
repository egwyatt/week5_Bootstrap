<div class="myjh"> <p2>Jimi Hendrix grew up in Seattle, Washington. From an early age he expressed interest in guitar. As a young boy he carried a stick around with him which he pretended was a guitar. One of his teacher's tried to get resources to buy Jimi a guitar worrying that the denial of such an outlet would result in psychiological damage. Though the guitar was never granted Jimi was able to find an old ukele and started working from there.
